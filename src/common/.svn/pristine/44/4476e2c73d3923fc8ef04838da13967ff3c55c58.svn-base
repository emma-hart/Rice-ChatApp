/**
 * This is the well-known status error message that is sent when a Remote Exception occurs
 * while trying to send data to an IMember. This error results because that member of the chatroom
 * has left without being properly disconnected.
 * 
 * Sending the message: It is strongly recommended to first remove the member who is causing the Remote
 * Exception from your local instance of members in the chatroom. Then you should send the IStatusError
 * to all remaining members of the chatroom.
 * 
 * Receiving the message: Remove the specified user from the chatroom.
